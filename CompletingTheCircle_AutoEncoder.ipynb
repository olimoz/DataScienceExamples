    "# Completing the Circle, A Language for Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "### By Oliver Morris\n",
    "\n",
    "Are programming languages half way to useful AI? In object orientated programming we specify a class to represent the attributes and methods of an object, then create instances from the class. In other words we start with a specification and create examples. But our human experience is often the reverse. Typically we are presented with many examples and attempt to generalise them into classes. Having done so, we apply our classes to simplify our world, then revise our understanding as our specifications are challenged. So, is there a case for a programming language capable of both halves of this circle between examples and classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a language could constantly adapt its classes to better meet some objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest deep learning model which approximates this circle is the autoencoder. An encoder takes instances and attempts to compress them into a latent space, this is analogous to extracting a class specification from examples. A decoder is required in order to train the encoder in a differentiable manner. Usually the latent space represents attributes of an object, but it could equally be tasked with finding the most concise specification of an action (class method), to meet some outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To repeat, the decoder is simply a differentiable manner of training the encoder. It would be preferable to use standard OOP to 'decode' the specification (latent space) into an instance. But such code would not be differentiable, requiring a reinforcement model as opposed to a straightforward neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a simple example of this loop and explore how it might be built. Consider the drawing of a straight line, there's standard python code for that. But imagine if we had a model which could interpret such lines and arrange them into a new, more complex class. For example, shapes, or even a face. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to keep it simple, we would like to train an encoder which can deconstruct images of lines into their most compressed format, (start, end, width, colour etc). This is the latent space. We would lie to use the python line method, from the img class, as the decoder. That method reads the latent space (start, end, width, colour etc) and draws a line. This would then be compared with the image being entered to the encoder. A loss could be calculated and we'd proceed from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated, we can't use the img.line method in the model's code, because its not differentiable. However we know the 'latent space' for specifying a line to be drawn by the img.line method (start, end, width, colour etc). We can generate examples of those specifications and the images which the method would have drawn using them. We can then train a decoder to do the same job as the img.line method. Having trained the decoder, we can train an encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long Term\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we'd like a deep reasoning tool, which can take instances then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - hypothesise defining attributes (features)\n",
    "    - using layers of those features, reduce the instances to their useful essence (latent space)\n",
    "    - using that latent space, hypothesise a classification or rule about the object (not sure what the deep learning analogy is)\n",
    "    - test those rules against further examples and adjust accordingly (train)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large number of problems which fit this pattern. So let's explore how this toy problem yields to this approach."

    "## Data Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is to train a decoder using a latent space which is usable by the img.line method. Then we can train an encoder to match.\n",
    "The decoder will input line specifications and output images of lines, doing the same task the img.line method would.\n",
    "\n",
    "img.line uses the following inputs:\n",
    "('x_start', 'y_start'), ('x_end', 'y_end'), 'linecol', 'linewid', 'imgcolr'\n",
